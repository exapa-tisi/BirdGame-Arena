# BirdGame Arena
## - Please spare me! If you have any feedback about my code, kindly make an issue! I'm not the best at programming, I especially struggle with organization, so feedback is greatly appreciated.

I'll try and base the characters on on both [@hexnestgames](https://www.instagram.com/hexnestgames/)'s and [@birdgame.three](https://www.instagram.com/birdgame.three/)'s versions of the game.

## Status:
### Working on base game

## Roadmap
- Base game setup (Porting from another project, I'll make is open source once its finished and cleaned up)
- Basic bird model + animations
- hitboxes, game mechanics, health
- Maps, skybox
- Optimisation (Might throw that into base game)
